#This code does an if statement which is a flow control when the temperature changes in different scenarios

temperature= 35
if temperature>40:
    print("it's a very hot day")
    print("drink lots of water")
elif temperature<45: # 20, 30
    print("it is a cold day")
    print("please dress warmly")
